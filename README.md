# DevTasker

A simple task management backend application. 

## Description

I hone my Go knowledge by implementing this system. The goal is to create a simple application but end-to-end. So basically, it will mimic a large scale system design, but with small application. 

These are things that I want to implement here.

- [x] Backend Endpoints
- [x] HTTP Handler
- [x] Validation and Logging
- [ ] Database
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [ ] Monitoring (prometheus)
- [ ] Docker
- [ ] GraphQL API
- [ ] gRPC Layer
