# DevTasker

A simple task management backend application.

## Description

I hone my Go knowledge by implementing this system. The goal is to create a simple application but end-to-end. So basically, it will mimic a large scale system design, but with small application.

These are things that I want to implement here.

- [x] Backend Endpoints
- [x] HTTP Handler
- [x] API docs
- [x] Validation and Logging
- [x] Database
- [ ] Unit Testing
- [x] Monitoring (prometheus)
- [x] Docker
- [x] CI/CD
- [x] Reverse Proxy (nginx)
- [ ] GraphQL API
- [ ] gRPC Layer

## Features

- **RESTful API:** For creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.
- **Go Fiber Framework:** High-performance Go web framework.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Robust and reliable database for storing task data.
- **GORM:** Developer-friendly ORM for Go.
- **Swagger Documentation:** Interactive API documentation.
- **Prometheus & Grafana:** For monitoring application metrics.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy:** Manages and routes traffic to the application and monitoring services.
- **Docker-Compose:** For easy setup and deployment of the entire application stack.
- **Live Reloading:** With Air for a better development experience.

## Getting Started

To get the application running locally, follow these steps after cloning the repository:

### Docker Compose

1. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create `.devtasker.env`, `.grafana.env`, and `.postgres.env` from the provided `.env.example` files and customize them if needed.

2. **Run with Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost`.

### Minikube

1. **Start Minikube:**
   ```bash
   minikube start
   ```

2. **Apply Kubernetes configurations:**
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/
   ```

3. **Get Minikube IP:**
   ```bash
   minikube ip
   ```

4. **Access the services:**
   - **Application:** `http://<minikube-ip>:31000`
   - **Swagger Docs:** `http://<minikube-ip>:31000/doc`
   - **Health Check:** `http://<minikube-ip>:31000/health`
   - **Grafana:** `http://<minikube-ip>:31001`
   - **Prometheus:** `http://<minikube-ip>:31002`

## Kubernetes & Minikube

Minikube is used to orchestrate the containerized applications (devtasker, nginx, prometheus, grafana, and postgres). It sets up a single-node Kubernetes cluster where the pods run. Each pod in this setup contains a single container.

The Kubernetes configurations in the `k8s/` directory were initially generated by translating the `docker-compose.yml` file using `kompose convert`. These configurations were then manually adjusted. Specifically, the `type` of the nginx, prometheus, and grafana services was changed to `NodePort` to make them accessible externally. Additionally, the devtasker image was updated to use a public image from Docker Hub.

To easily access the services, you can run `minikube service <service-name>`, where `<service-name>` can be `nginx`, `grafana`, or `prometheus`. This command will automatically open the service in your web browser.

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

| Method | Endpoint      | Description          |
| ------ | ------------- | -------------------- |
| POST   | `/task`       | Create a new task    |
| GET    | `/task`       | Get all tasks        |
| GET    | `/task/:id`   | Get a task by ID     |
| PATCH  | `/task/:id`   | Update a task        |
| DELETE | `/task/:id`   | Delete a task        |

- **Swagger Docs:** `http://localhost/doc`
- **Health Check:** `http://localhost/health`

## Monitoring

- **Prometheus:** `http://localhost:9090`
- **Grafana:** `http://localhost:3001`
